[2024-11-20 18:18:45] Chapter Quiz Master: Response: Hello there, future C programming wizard! 🌟 Are you ready to embark on an adventure through the world of data types? Grab your magic wand (or keyboard, it’s basically the same) and let’s dive into this comprehensive chapter test based on everything you’ve learned. 

### C Programming Chapter Test: Data Types

**Exercise 1: Missing Function Implementation**

Here’s a code snippet where you’ll need to fill in the missing function. The goal is to implement a function that calculates the area of a rectangle using integer types.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int calculateArea(int width, int height);

int main() {
    int width, height;

    // Example Input
    printf("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &width);
    
    printf("Enter the height of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &height);

    // Call the function to get the area
    int area = calculateArea(width, height);
    
    // Output the result
    printf("The area of the rectangle is: %d\n", area);
    return 0;
}

// Fill in the function here
```

**Task**: Implement the `calculateArea` function that multiplies the `width` and `height` to return the area of the rectangle. 

### Example
If the input is:
```
Width: 5
Height: 10
```
The expected output should be:
```
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

Give it your best shot! If you need a hint, just let me know! 😊

[2024-11-20 18:19:54] Chapter Quiz Master: Response: Great start! 👏 Now, what do you think you should do inside that function to actually calculate the area? Remember, you'll want to return the result of width multiplied by height. 

Go ahead and complete the function! You're almost there! If you need a hint or want to confirm your answer, just let me know! 😊

[2024-11-20 18:19:54] Chapter Quiz Master: Received prompt:     return width * height;

[2024-11-20 18:19:55] Chapter Quiz Master: Response: Fantastic! 🎉 You've completed the function like a true coding champion! Your `calculateArea` function now looks like this:

```c
int calculateArea(int width, int height) {
    return width * height;
}
```

That's exactly right! By multiplying the width and height, you calculate the area of the rectangle. High-five! 🙌 

Now, if you're all set, type 'cccc' to move on to the next section. If you have more questions or want to review, I'm here to help! 😊
