Teaching Cycle for: int
==================================================

LECTURE:
Hello there! 😊 I'm excited to dive into the world of C programming with you today. Our topic is one of the fundamental concepts: **Data Types**, with a focus on the **int** type. 

So, let's get started!

### What is an `int`?

In C, `int` is a data type used to store **integers**, which are whole numbers. This means you can store numbers like **123**, **-123**, or even **0**. However, you cannot store numbers with decimals, like **19.99**. 

### Why Use `int`?

Using `int` is essential when you need to perform calculations that involve whole numbers, such as counting items, indexing arrays, or working with loops. 

### Modifiers for `int`

Now, here's where it gets interesting! The basic `int` can be modified to change its storage capacity and whether it can hold negative values or not. Let's break this down:

- **short int**: This type uses less memory, typically 16 bits, which means it can store smaller integers. It’s useful when you're sure your numbers won’t exceed that range.
  
- **long int**: This type uses more memory, usually 32 or 64 bits, allowing you to store much larger integers. You'd use this when you're working with numbers that might exceed the standard `int` range.

- **unsigned int**: This type only stores non-negative integers (0 and positive numbers). By using `unsigned int`, you effectively double the maximum positive range of numbers you can store since it ignores the negative side.

### Storage Length

Typically, across most systems, an `int` is 32 bits, which means it can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. However, this can vary based on the system architecture. If you need to store even larger integers, you can use `long long int`, which can hold even bigger values!

### Example Code

Here’s a simple example to illustrate:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;                  // a regular integer
    unsigned int b = 20;        // a non-negative integer
    short int c = 5;            // a smaller integer
    long int d = 3000000000;    // a larger integer
    long long int e = 9223372036854775807; // even larger integer

    printf("Regular int: %d\n", a);
    printf("Unsigned int: %u\n", b);
    printf("Short int: %hd\n", c);
    printf("Long int: %ld\n", d);
    printf("Long long int: %lld\n", e);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We declare several types of integers: `int`, `unsigned int`, `short int`, `long int`, and `long long int`.
- We then print each of these variables using the appropriate format specifiers (`%d` for `int`, `%u` for `unsigned int`, `%hd` for `short int`, `%ld` for `long int`, and `%lld` for `long long int`).
- Each `printf` statement outputs the value of the corresponding variable to the console.
