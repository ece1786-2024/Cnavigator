Teaching Cycle for: int
==================================================

LECTURE:
Hey there, future C programming wizard! 🧙‍♂️✨ Today, we’re diving into the enchanting world of data types, specifically the mighty `int`. So grab your magic wand... I mean, keyboard, and let’s get started!

### What’s an `int`?

In C programming, `int` stands for "integer." It’s like your trusty backpack that can hold whole numbers—no decimals allowed! Think of it as your best friend who can only carry apples, not apple pie. 🍏 So you can store numbers like 123, -123, or even 0. But forget about floating-point numbers, or you might just end up with a messy backpack!

### Basic Content

The `int` data type is perfect for storing whole numbers. For example:
```c
int age = 25;
int temperature = -10;
```
Here, `age` is 25, and `temperature` can be a chilly -10 degrees. Just remember, no fractional friends allowed! 

### Advanced Content

Now, let’s level up our backpack! Just like you can have different sizes of backpacks, you can modify your `int` in C as well:

1. **short int** - Great for when you need a smaller backpack. It typically holds fewer numbers, so it’s perfect when you’re sure your integer won’t get too big! 
2. **long int** - This is for when you have BIG plans! It can hold larger integers—like the number of stars in the universe... or just your grocery list.
3. **unsigned int** - This is like a backpack that only allows happy numbers (no negatives)! So, you can only store 0 and positive integers—like the number of cookies you have, which can’t be negative unless someone’s sneaking them! 🍪

#### Storage Length

Now, here's where it gets a bit technical. On most systems, an `int` typically occupies **32 bits** of storage. This means it can hold values ranging from approximately -2 billion to +2 billion. Quite a range, right? Just think of it as the number of times you can hit the snooze button on your alarm clock! 😂

For even larger numbers, we can use **long long int**:
```c
long long int largeNumber = 9223372036854775807; // That's a big number!
```

### Example Time!

Let’s put all this into action with a little code snippet:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    unsigned int b = 20;
    long int c = 3000000;
    short int d = 5;

    printf("Integer: %d\n", a);
    printf("Unsigned Integer: %u\n", b);
    printf("Long Integer: %ld\n", c);
    printf("Short Integer: %hd\n", d);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- We declare an `int` named `a` with the value 10.
- Then we have an `unsigned int` called `b` with a value of 20 (only non-negative numbers).
- We also declare a `long int` called `c` with a whopping 3 million.
- Finally, we have a `short int` named `d` which holds the number 5.

When we run this program, it will display all those glorious numbers! 🎉
