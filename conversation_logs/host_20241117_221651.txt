#### Chapter Title: Data Type

---

#### Basic Content:

1. **Integer Data Type:**
   - Understand how to store integers (whole numbers) without decimals, using examples like 123 or -123.

2. **Floating-point Data Type:**
   - Learn about storing floating-point numbers that include decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.

3. **Character Data Type:**
   - Explore how to store single characters, with examples such as 'a' or 'B', noting that characters are enclosed in single quotes.

---

#### Advanced Content:

1. **Integer Modifiers:**
   - Discover how integer modifiers can alter the storage range and sign of an int, including short int, long int, and unsigned int.
   - Gain insights into the standard storage length of int across systems (typically 32-bit) and learn about long long int for larger ranges.

2. **Floating-point Types:**
   - Delve into different floating-point types that store decimal numbers, emphasizing double for higher precision and long double for larger ranges.
   - Understand floating-point representation, including the use of scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e4) and the implications of rounding errors in calculations.

3. **Character Arrays and Strings:**
   - Expand your knowledge of char data type to include character arrays and strings, using examples like `char name[] = "Alice"`.
   - Learn to differentiate between signed char and unsigned char and how this affects character range.
   - Familiarize yourself with ASCII and Unicode encoding for international applications and handling multilingual characters.
