Data Type,int,"Stores integers (whole numbers) without decimals, such as 123 or -123.","In addition to storing integers, modifiers can change the storage range and sign of int, such as short int and long int for smaller or larger ranges, and unsigned int for non-negative integers, expanding positive range. Understand int storage length across systems (typically 32-bit) and the use of long long int for larger ranges."
Data Type,float,"Stores floating-point numbers with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.","Floating-point types store decimal numbers with different levels of precision and range, e.g., double for higher precision, suitable for precise calculations, and long double for larger ranges. Understand floating-point representation, scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e4), and rounding errors in calculations."
Data Type,char,"Stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes.","In addition to storing single characters, char can be extended for character arrays and strings, e.g., char name[] = 'Alice'. Differentiate between signed char and unsigned char and their effect on character range. Learn ASCII and Unicode encoding for international applications and handling multilingual characters."

Branch and Jumps,swith,,
Branch and Jumps,if,Use if to specify a block of code that will execute if a certain condition is true.,Use nested if statements to test multiple conditions inside each other. This can be helpful when you need to test multiple conditions that are related.
Branch and Jumps,else if,Use else if to specify a new condition to test if the original if condition is false., You can use multiple else if statements to check for multiple alternative conditions if the initial if condition is false.
